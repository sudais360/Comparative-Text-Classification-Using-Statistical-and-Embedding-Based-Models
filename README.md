# Comparative Text Classification Using Statistical and Embedding-Based Models

## Overview
This project explores the effectiveness of both statistical and embedding-based models in the task of text classification, specifically for categorizing news articles into predefined classes: World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech. The project is a part of the CM3060 Natural Language Processing midterm coursework.

## Project Structure
- **Report**: The detailed analysis and results are documented in the `CM3060_Natural_Language_Processing_Midterm - Jupyter Notebook.pdf`.
- **Data**: The project uses the AG's News Topic Classification Dataset, which is preprocessed and analyzed in the notebook.
- **Notebook**: The `CM3060_Natural_Language_Processing_Midterm.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook contains all code, visualizations, and detailed explanations of the steps involved in the analysis.

## Models Implemented
1. **Baseline Model (Bag of Words + Naive Bayes)**: A simple model that converts text into numerical features using the Bag of Words (BoW) representation and applies Naive Bayes for classification.
2. **Statistical Model (TF-IDF + Support Vector Machine)**: This model uses TF-IDF to weigh the importance of words and then trains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.
3. **Embedding-Based Model (Word2Vec + Long Short-Term Memory)**: Word embeddings generated by Word2Vec are used as input to an LSTM network, capturing long-term dependencies and sequential patterns in text.

## Dataset
- **AG's News Topic Classification Dataset**: The dataset consists of 120,000 training samples and 7,600 testing samples, categorized into four classes: World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech.
  - **Training Samples**: 120,000
  - **Testing Samples**: 7,600

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Measures the ratio of correctly predicted instances.
- **Precision**: Measures the accuracy of positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Measures the ability to find all relevant cases within a dataset.
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Displays actual versus predicted classifications.

## How to Run the Project
